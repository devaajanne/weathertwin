# Weather Twin

Weather Twin a fun, silly little app to find which city in the world has the same weather as your location.

This is the repository for the server-side application. For the client-side repository, see here: https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-client.

The JSON files of cities with their latitudes and longitudes as well as of countries and their country codes have been created with AI. The base for the files have been these two GitHub repositories:

- cities-json by lmfmaier: https://github.com/lmfmaier/cities-json
- ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes by lukes: https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes

## API documentation

The app provides one endpoint, api/weatherdata.

The endpoint allows fetching weather data for the input location, and querying the repository for a similar weather data. This endpoint does not require authentication or authorization.

As a result, the endpoint retuns the weather for the input location as well as the weather for a location that has a similar weather .
