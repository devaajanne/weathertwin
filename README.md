# Weather Twin

Weather Twin a fun, silly little app to find which city in the world has the same weather as your location.

This is the repository for the server-side application. For the client-side repository, see here: https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-client.

## API documentation

The app provides one endpoint, api/weatherdata.

The endpoint allows fetching weather data for the input location, and querying the repository for a similar weather data. This endpoint does not require authentication or authorization.

As a result, the endpoint retuns the weather for the input location as well as the weather for a location that has a similar weather.

```json
{
  "cityName": "Helsinki, Finland",
  "cityCoords": {
    "lat": 60.1675,
    "lon": 24.9427
  },
  "unit": "metric"
}
```

### Success reponses

**Condition** : Data provided in the body is valid and a similar location has been found.

**Code** : `200 OK`

**Content example** : Returns a JSON object with two properties: `inputLocation` and `similarLocation`. Both include the weather data for their respective locations. `temp` is in the unit given in the body.

```json
{
  "similarLocation": {
    "id": 134601,
    "lat": 32.941,
    "lon": 50.121,
    "city": "FareydÅ«nshahr",
    "countryCode": "IR",
    "countryName": "Iran",
    "weatherGroup": "Clouds",
    "temp": -5.6
  },
  "inputLocation": {
    "id": 658225,
    "lat": 60.1675,
    "lon": 24.9427,
    "city": "Helsinki",
    "countryCode": "FI",
    "countryName": "Finland",
    "weatherGroup": "Clouds",
    "temp": -5.4
  }
}
```
**Condition** : Data provided in the body is valid but a similar location has not been found.

**Code** : `200 OK`

**Content example** : Returns a JSON object with two properties: `inputLocation` and `similarLocation`. Only the `inputLocation` contains its respective weather data, whereas `similarLocation` is `null`. `temp` is in the unit given in the body.

```json
{
  "similarLocation": null,
  "inputLocation": {
    "id": 658225,
    "lat": 60.1675,
    "lon": 24.9427,
    "city": "Helsinki",
    "countryCode": "FI",

    "temp": -5.4
  }
}

<details>
<summary>What are the technologies used in the project?</summary>
This repository houses the back-end side of the WeatherTwin application. It has been written in Java version 23, using Spring Boot version 3.4.2 and Gradle version 8.11.1. For reading JSON files, Jackson library is used. For the front-end side of the project, written in JavaScript and React, see this repository: https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-client
</details>


<details>
<summary>Why do you use a runtime database and not a persistent database?</summary>
This is most likely a temporary solution and fixed later, but the main reason was that this application features only one table: weatherdatatable. This is the table that is used to store fetched weather data from OpenWeatherMap API which has been converted into weatherData entities. As this is the only table in the whole application, and as the data in the table is updated every hour (ie. the weather data gets outdated fast, since weather changes), a runtime database with H2 is good for now.
