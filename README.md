# Weather Twin

Weather Twin a fun, silly little app to find which city in the world has the same weather as your location.

This is the repository for the server-side application. For the client-side repository, see here: https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-client.

## Deployment

Weather Twin is now live at GitHub pages! See the app here: https://devaajanne.github.io/weathertwin-client/

## API documentation

The app provides one endpoint, api/weatherdata.

The endpoint allows fetching weather data for the input location, and querying the repository for a similar weather data. This endpoint does not require authentication or authorization.

As a result, the endpoint retuns the weather for the input location as well as the weather for a location that has a similar weather.

<details>
<summary>Why did you decide to create this application?</summary>
This was a training / hobby project. I wanted to learn more about back and front end development and deepen my knowledge about the technologies used in the project. I also wanted to create an application that requires no log-in so that the app is simple, easy to use, and hopefully fun as well!

<details>
<summary>What are the technologies used in the project?</summary>
This repository houses the back-end side of the WeatherTwin application. It has been written in Java version 23, using Spring Boot version 3.4.2 and Gradle version 8.11.1. Database has been created with PostgreSQL with database migration with Liquibase. For reading JSON files, Jackson library is used. For the front-end side of the project, written in JavaScript and React, see this repository: https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-client
